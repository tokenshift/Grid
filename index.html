              A simple, responsive CSS grid that enables you to easily

            <h3>Screen Sizes</h3>
            <p>
              You are viewing this page on a
              <b class="show-s">small</b>
              <b class="show-m">medium</b>
              <b class="show-l">large</b>
              screen. Go ahead and resize the window to watch the layout
              adjust.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Grid</b> supports three different screen sizes, identified by a
              single-character prefix: <b>s</b>mall, <b>m</b>edium or
              <b>l</b>arge. You can think of these as corresponding to
              <em>mobile</em>, <em>tablet</em> and <em>desktop</em> respectively.       
            </p>
            <p>
              To show or hide an element when at a specific size, use the
              <code>.X-show</code> and <code>.X-hide</code> classes, where
              <b>X</b> is the relevant size prefix. Elements marked as
              <code>.X-show</code> will be displayed <em>only</em> at the
              specified size; elements with <code>.X-hide</code> will be
              displayed at every size <em>except</em> the one specified.
            </p>

              <h3>Usage</h3>
              <p>
                Unlike some grid systems, <b>Grid</b> does not define a container
                size. Instead, rows will expand to fill the available space. This
                allows you to use <b>Grid</b> for an entire page, a page
                container, or even a single section of a page, as needed.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                There are three different grid types you can use: 12-column, 16-
                column or 24-column. You can also use <em>overrides</em>
                (<a href="#overrides">see below</a>) if you need different grid
                types in different places. This page uses a 12-column grid,
                defined in <code>grid-12.css</code>.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                <em>Rows</em> are defined using the <code>.row</code> class. Use
                rows to horizontally align a set of components. Inside each row,
                mark blocks as <code>.cell-1</code> through <code>.cell-12</code>
                to configure how many columns that cell will consume.
              </p>
  
              <section id="push-pull">
                <h4>Push/Pull</h4>
  
                <p>
                  You can use <code>.push-</code> and <code>.pull-</code> classes
                  to reorder the visual display of cells in a row. For example,
                  <code>.push-2</code> applied to a cell will move it two columns
                  to the right. <em>Push</em> and <em>pull</em> will often be
                  used in pairs, to swap cell positions, but can also be used to
                  create row-level indentation.
                </p>
              </section>
  
              <section id="centered">
                <h4>Centered</h4>
  
                <p>
                  The <code>.center</code> class can be applied to a cell of any
                  size to center the cell in the row. It works best if the
                  centered cell is the only content of the row; if there are any
                  other cells, they should be defined before the centered cell,
                  and <a href="#push-pull">pushed/pulled</a> into the correct
                  position.
                </p>
              </section>
  
              <section id="nesting">
                <h4>Nesting</h4>
  
                <p>
                  Grids can be nested to arbitrary depth; just put a
                  <code>.row</code> inside another <code>.row</code>. To remove
                  the outer margin, add the <code>.inner</code> class to the row.
                </p>
              </section>
  
              <section id="responsive">
                <h4>Responsive</h4>
  
                <p>
                  There are screen-size-prefixed versions of all of the normal
                  <code>.cell-</code>, <code>.push-</code> and
                  <code>.pull-</code> classes. These can be used to override the
                  size or position of a cell when at a specific screen size. For
                  example, a cell could be marked as
                  <code>.cell-4 .cell-s-12</code> to take up the full width on
                  small screens, such as mobile phones, or a third of the width
                  on larger screens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each screen size also has <code>.show-</code> and
                  <code>.hide-</code> classes to display or hide content,
                  respectively,

              <h3>Overrides</h3>

              <p>
                Only one <code>grid-X.css</code> stylesheet can be used on a
                page. If more than one grid style is needed, you can link
                additional <code>grid-X-override.css</code> stylesheets. These
                provide <code>.row-X</code> and <code>.grid-X</code> classes
                that can be used to override the number of columns for a
                specific row or entire section, respectively.
              </p>

              <h3>Support</h3>
  
              <p>
                <b>Grid</b> makes use of the <code>box-sizing</code> CSS
                attribute in order to keep the size down; unfortunately, this
                means only IE 8+ is supported.
